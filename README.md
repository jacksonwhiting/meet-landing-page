## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Utility Library

### What I learned

This was another good chance to practice using Tailwind CSS. It took me a minute to work out the footer with the background color laid on top of the image. Several different ways to do it but I chose using a linear gradient and a background image as essentially two background images. The linear gradient wasn't actually a gradient but all one color but it allowed me to add both as background images.

### Continued development

More challenging scenarios to work with Tailwind.
